# Roadgeek 2014

Hi, 
  This project uses the beautiful Roadgeek 2014 Series D typeface, created by 2015 Sammi De Guzman.  I've placed a note from him and the copyright for the typeface (which is very permissive and open for use in projects like these) below. 

Roadgeek 2014 Series D is included here as a TTF font.  If you don't already have it on your local computer, you will need to install it to use the intended fonts in the graphics files.  

This typeface is beautiful, and I'd like to thank Sammi for making it.  You can follow his work here:

Thanks, 

M.

Roadgeek 2014 is a set of fonts that replicates typefaces used on highway signs 
in various countries.

This project is an update of Michael Adams' [Roadgeek 2005](http://n1en.org/roadgeek/)
fonts, which had a few outstanding issues as discussed here:
[What's wrong with the Roadgeek fonts](http://www.aaroads.com/forum/index.php?topic=12353.0).
Roadgeek 2005  includes the US, UK and German sign typefaces; with Roadgeek
2014 I plan to expand that set.
