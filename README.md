## The People's Crest is yours. 

The People's Crest is an original design intended to capture the passion of being an American soccer fan. The crest was created by M.Willis, and is maintained by Clean Sheet Co.  

We have made the entire design, including digital components, vector art, and source files freely available to the U.S. soccer community (and/or anybody who wants it).  Download it, adopt it, remix it, fork it.  Make it yours.  The idea, hopefully, is to create a fan talisman that is fully owned and loved by the American soccer fan.
