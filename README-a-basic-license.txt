Hi! This is short and sweet as licenses go.

This means, basically, that you are free to use these files, publicly or privately, as you wish.  Change colors, text, shapes, move stuff around - make it yours. Our hope is that you will base something great on this mark and that it will flourish within the US Soccer community.  

There are a few basic provisos:

1. You can't use these files to make a product for sale.  Clean Sheet Co. retains the commercial license to this mark and its derivatives. If you want to sell something, get in touch with Clean Sheet Co. (info@cleansheet.co) and discuss with us what you're looking to do. We can license this mark to you commercially, and we may even be able to help you make something. 

That said, if you're an individual or small group that would like to make small run of something (like a t-shirt or a scarf) for supporters that features or adapts this mark, and you need to charge to make it work, just drop us a line to let us know what you're looking to do. Chances are it's cool with us. 

2. If you do use, adapt, and/or publish work based on this mark, please let the world know about Clean Sheet Co. and our role in the project!

3. If you do use, adapt and/or publish work based on this mark, you must make the source of your work available to others in the same spirit that we're making this available to you. Share your work, let others build on it, and appreciate it as it grows.  

4. We believe in inclusion, compassion, and peace. Anyone who would use or adapt this mark to promote the opposite - hatred, bigotry, segregation, intolerance or violence - is unwelcome to do so. 

Thanks! We can't wait to see what you do with it. Go US.

Owner, Clean Sheet Co.
